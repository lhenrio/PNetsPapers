\subsection*{Context}




In the previous years, we have studied theoretical foundations for open
systems and we defined  open automata \cite{arxiv-weakbisim,henrio:Forte2016,hou:hal-02406098} that can be seen as labelled transition systems (LTSs) with parameters and holes. The transitions of open
automata are much more complex than transitions of an LTS: they include guards expressing the relations between the parameters of the automaton with the actions of the holes, and assignments encoding their effects.
% as the firing on a transition depends on parameters and actions that are symbolic.
 We proved that our models 
have good properties, namely that composition preserves some properties like bisimulation.



The composition of open automata refers to filling holes, it requires to check the compatibility of their sorts. Nowadays, we simply verify the compatibility of two automata to be composed based on   action labels and  arity. But, 
 we are interested in enriching holes with description of behaviours to give them enough power and enable us to check equivalences for these open systems. The description will characterise all the
interactions and the series of inputs and outputs of data exchanged between the automata and its surroundings. Precisely, the theory of session types and behavioural types  \cite{Fantechi:MLTCDP2019} are intended  to describe dynamic aspects of the behaviour of processes.

 
To tackle this issue, we ask: { \it Can we synthesise a global type from a collection of automata in order to ensure the composability of an open automaton  with a compatible  surrounding automaton? }



\subsection*{Objectives}

The main objective of the internship is to deal with the characterization of interactions  of open automaton with its environment. These interactions can be characterised as behavioural types.
More specifically, the internship would follow the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Familiarization with technical material: the semantics of  open automata and the notion behavioural types \cite{Hans:2016} that allows to describe the dynamic aspects of processes. In particular the notion of session types that focus on process interactions should be studied.

\item Design of an adequate characterisation of  compatibility condition  suitable for the composition open automata, and study the guarantees brought by this condition. 

\item Application to the proof of absence of deadlock upon composition.

\item  We additionally have defined a notion of refinement between open automata that would benefit from such behavioural types. One additional objective of the internship could be to improve the definition of refinement based on the notion of behavioural types that has been defined in the previous steps.

\item Design of examples demonstrating the benefit of this work.
