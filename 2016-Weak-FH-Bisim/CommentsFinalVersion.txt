Reviewer #1: The authors have carefully taken into account the comments from their reviewers and the resulting version is a much improved version of the original submission. I think that it is ready for publication, after the authors have fixed the minor comments below and have done a final round of spell checking.

Page references are as in the file and refer to the version of the article with highlighted modifications.

Page 2: verification platform use --> verification platform uses

Page 4 (and possibly elsewhere): bisimularity --> bisimilarity

Page 8, Example 1: I would write "The left hole is indexed by $L$ and the right hole by $R$."

I would also write "The sub-net is a LTS..."

make variables global, ---> we only use global variables,

Page 10: are disjoints --> are disjoint


Page 11: Holes(P)is a set of indexes --> Holes(P) is a s et of indices

ar pLTSs --> are pLTSs

Page 14: on formatting of SOS rules --> on formats for SOS rules/on SOS rule formats

Page 15: a semantics and logical understanding --> a semantic and logical understanding

Page 23: Figure 4.1 --> Figure 4.1. => Fait mais c'était une erreur pas la bonne figure

Page 38: To improve scaling --> To improve scalability

Page 39: ogf pNets --> of pNets




Reviewer #2: It seems to me that the authors have addressed all the comments of the reviewers in a fully satisfactory way.
The cover letter illustrates all main issues in detail and the version with highlighted changes simplified considerably
the revision of the second version. The quality of the revised version has been quite improved and is ready for publication.
A small list of typos and one question that puzzles me follow.


Question: is it true that if the triple (s,t|Pred) is in the bisimilarity relation, then
any triple (s,t|Pred') with Pred' => Pred is also in the bisimilarity relation?
*** => i guess it is bisimulation, the answer is NO, comment added ***

P3,L-6: bisimularity -> bisimilarity
(there are a couple more occurrences of the same typo, I suggest to find&replace them all:
P5,L12 - P34,L16)

P6,L1: does a range over action labels or action names?

P7,L3: is \pluscup is -> \pluscup is

P8,L2: an labelled -> a labelled

** TODO **
CCS choice example: it seems that l and r stands for two specific actions: what about a and b?
are they singular actions or stand as placeholders for any action of the holes L and R?

P8,L18: make variables -> here we make variables

P16,L17: state -> states

P21: merge footnotes 6 and 7 in a single one (the text of the second refers the first)
Also pay attention to the fact that not all notes begin with capital letter and not all of them end with "."
See e.g. footnotes 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19.

P34,L-2: one the states -> one of the states

** TODO **
P36,L-3: off -> of  => Pas trouvé

P42: references [25] and [26] refer the same paper

P45,L2: Bisimulation -> Bisimilarity

P45,L3: Bisimulation -> Bisimilarity

P56,L11: \otimes -> \odot

P89,L-10: a0 -> b0

P92,last transition: ??_msg (?)

P94,L20: Appendix Appendix -> Appendix

P94,L28: -> -> \rightarrow
