abstract="We provide a solution for the design of safe concurrent systems by compositional application of verified design patterns---called architectures---to a small set of functional components. To this end, we extend the theory of architectures developed previously for the BIP framework with the elements necessary for handling data: definition and operations on data domains, syntax and semantics of composition operators involving data transfer. We provide a set of conditions under which composition of architectures preserves their characteristic safety properties. To verify that individual architectures do enforce their associated properties, we provide an encoding into open pNets, an intermediate model that supports SMT-based verification. The approach is illustrated by a case study based on a previously developed BIP model of a nanosatellite on-board software.",
