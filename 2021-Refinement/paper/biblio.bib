In distributed systems, components can also be used to provide an abstraction of locations: each component is a unit of deployment that can be placed on a different machine. In this article, we consider this kind of distributed components that are additionally loosely coupled and communicate by asynchronous invocations. Components also provide a convenient abstraction for verifying the correct behaviour of systems: they provide structuring entities easing the correctness verification. This article provides a formal background for the generation of behavioural semantics for asynchronous components. It expresses the semantics of hierarchical distributed components communicating asynchronously by requests, futures, and replies; this semantics is provided using the pNet intermediate language. This article both demonstrates the expressiveness of the pNet model and formally specifies the complete process of the generation of a behavioural model for a distributed component system. The purpose of our behavioural semantics is to allow for verification both by finite instantiation and model-checking, and by techniques for infinite systems.}

  abstract = {Open Automata (OA) are symbolic and parameterized models for open concurrent systems. Here open means partially specified systems, that can be instantiated or assembled to build bigger systems. An important property for such systems is ”compositionality”, meaning that logical properties, and equivalences, can be checked locally, and will be preserved by composition. In previous work, a notion of equivalence named FH-Bisimulation was defined for open-automata, and proved to be a congruence for their composition. But this equivalence was defined for a variant of open-automata that are intrinsically infinite, making it unsuitable for algorithmic treatment. We define a new form of equivalence named StrFH-Bisimulation, working on finite encodings of OAs. We prove that StrFH-Bisimulation is consistent and complete with respect to the FH-Bisimulation. Then we propose two algorithms to check StrFH-Bisimulation: the first one requires a (user-defined) relation between the states of two finite OAs, and checks whether it is a StrFH-Bisimulation. The second one takes two finite OAs as input, and builds a weakest StrFH-bisimulation such that their initial states are bisimilar. We prove that this algorithm terminates when the data domains are finite. Both algorithms use an SMT-solver as a basis to solve the proof obligations.},

  abstract="The B method has been successfully used to specify many industrial applications by refinement. Previously, we proposed enriching the B event systems by formulating its dynamic properties in LTL. This enables us to combine model-checking with theorem-proving verification technologies. The model-checking of LTL formulae necessitates that the B event system semantics is a transition system. In this paper, we express the refinement relation by a relationship between transition systems. A result of our study shows that this relation is a special kind of simulation allowing us to exploit the partition of the reachable state space for a modular verification of LTL formulae. The results of the paper allow us to build a bridge between the above view of the refinement and the notions of observability characterized as simulation relations by Milner, van Glabbeek, Bloom and others. The refinement relation we define in the paper is a ready-simulation generalization which is similar to the refusal simulation of Ulidowsky. The way the relation is defined allows us to obtain a compositionality result w.r.t. parallel composition operation.",

The proposed relations allow extension of functionality, whilst preserving behavioural properties. A notion of extensibility is defined on top of a behavioural relation called convergence, which distinguishes inputs from outputs and the context where they are communicated, allowing extensions to reuse existing events with different purposes. We mechanise the strategy for extensibility verification using the FDR4 tool, and illustrate our results with an autonomous healthcare robot case study.}
