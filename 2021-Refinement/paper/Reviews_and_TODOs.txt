----- TEXT:
This paper mainly defines a type of simulation relation for a type of automata, called ``Open Automata’’. The authors discuss a new type of bisimualtion relation which is related to axiom semantics of open automata, based on which proposed a simulation relation with and without holes that support good properties such as transitivity, congruence and compositionality. 
The paper is written in good English and is organized in a well structure. However, I personally cannot agree with the motivation of the ``FH-bisimulation’’ introduced in Section 2.4, where the authors connect the notion of bisimulation relation to the transition conditions and the formulas satisfied by states. The reason I did not reject this paper is that I am not an expert on open automata, so I might have missed some critical motivations of this work, which in my opinion is not stated clearly in this paper. 

The motivation of proposing a different bisimulation relation from the classical one (you give by Definition 5) is not clear. Bisimulation describes an equivalence between the operational behaviours of two systems. So it should be only related to the system observable actions (here \alpha, \beta, ...), rather than the guarded conditions of actions or formulas satisfied by states. I guess the authors somehow mix up two concepts: operational semantics and bisimulation relation. How a state satisfies a formula, meets a deadlock, proceeds an action under a guarded condition, these are the operational semantics of an automaton; How two automatons relate to each other by their actions, that is bisimulation (or simulation) relation. So, the definition of a bisimulation R should have nothing to do with the semantics of two automatons. The example given above Definition 6, to me, does not make sense. The authors say ``the two OAs should be considered as bisimular’’, why? I don’t think so. In classical bisimulation relation, whether the two OAs are bisimular depends on the following operational behaviours from state t and t’ compared to from state t2, not by the guard conditions from s to t’ and t’. In fact, they might not be bisimular to each other, even if you give the same guard conditions from s to t’ and t. Check the classical example at the beginning of the paper [Milner84].

Il a rien compris: il donne un exemple sans guard et il croit qu on ne regarde pas la suite des operations :(

So the authors should give a more convincing example to explain why a particular bisimulation needs to be introduced instead of using the classical one. 
Besides, the motivation of Section 5 is not strong. Concrete examples should be given. The hole-tracking simulation is a very nice relation that supports good properties. But is it really useful in practice? And to me, its possession of these properties (transitivity, congruence and compositionality) seems quite straightforward, if we only speak of the ``common holes'' of two automata. I guess the authors need to expand what is the challenge when comparing two automatons with a concrete example, and explain in detail any challenges encountered while proving these properties. 
--> concrete example Ludo???

Other typos and technical problems are listed below, but not limited to:

1.At the beginning of page 3, the definition a simulation relation ---> the definition OF a simulation relation
--> Done
2.At the beginning of Section 2.1, I suggest using the notion of ``sequence’’, or ``infinite sequence’’, rather than ``families of values’’, if what you deal with is always countable or finite. 
--> Ludo : countable
DONE

3.Before Section 2.2, ``We suppose given a decidable satisfiability relation on closed formulas,’’ I don’t understand what this sentence means. And here personally do not recommend using $\vdash$ as the denotation of ``satisfaction relation''. It usually means ``deduction relation''. Instead using $\models$ or $\vDash$ would be more appropriate. 
Decidable done.

4.In Definition 1, is $\beta_j$ an action or a set of actions? Not clear.  Need to state it clearly that \beta represent a sequence of actions of holes. 
DONE

5.In Definition 3, where J'_c and J'_p are defined?

6.In Fig.4, there is no actions for P?

7.The explanation below Definition 4 is not intuitive, Better explain provided with a concrete example.

8.In Definition 6, what does t_x | Pred_{s', tx} mean? Please explain it in some place. 
DONE

9.2nd paragraph of Section 3, ``Indeed, the possible transitions are better characterized by the guards of the outgoing transitions from a given state, rather than the simple existence of a transition’’, couldn’t understand this sentence. 
REPHRASED

10.Example 3, ``We can easily check that this automaton simulates the one of Fig. 2. ‘’, I think it should be that the automaton of Fig. 2 can simulate this one?  
DONE

11.Example 4, this example to me is not good. As it does not really show the difference between hole-equal simulation and hole-tracking simulation. 
NO

12.Below Definition 10, ``but it is the best necessary condition that can be identified for compositionality of simulation’’, why is the best? Any evidence to support this statement?

----- TEXT:
The authors introduce two simulation relations between open automata: one between OAs with the same sets of holes and another one with not necessarily the same sets of holes (with hole-tracking). They prove three properties of the hole-tracking simulation relation: (1)	the relation is a preorder (i.e. a reflexive and transitive relation),
(2)	if two OAs are related, by applying operation of substituting a fixed hole with a fixed automaton, we get related OAs,
(3)	if two OAs are related, by substituting them in a fixed hole of the same automaton, we get two related automata.
Combyining the previous results, the authors get the proof of composability:
(4)	Substituting same holes of two related OAs with two related autoamata we get two related OAs.

Although the manuscript needs a careful revision, I believe that the considered extension of previous results on open automata is interesting and I am confident that it will attract the interest of SEFM participants. 
The manuscript would benefit from more explanations given on examples, definitions and connections between examples and definitions.

Some comments and suggestions:

Abstract, Line 4: Replace “relation” with “relationship”

-> Done
Page 2, Line 12-13: Replace “one frequently used…simulation” with “with trace inclusion or simulation being frequently used relations”

--> Done

Page 2, Line -18: Replace “infinite state” with “infinite-state”

Page 2, Line -14: Replace “Because of their the generic nature” with “Due to their generic nature”

--> Done
Page 2, Line -13: The part of sentence “…we already illustrated previousy …” is not appropriate from two reasons: it sounds like something was previously illustrated in the present paper, and the authors of cited papers [5],[6] and [15] do not include all the authors of the present papers. I would suggest to rephrase it.

Page 2, Line -10: Replace “has already” with “exhibited”
--> Done
Page 2, Line -10: Replace “relatively to” with “concerning”

-->Done
Page 2, Line -6: Replace “And with” with “It possesses”
--> Done
Page 2, Line -1: Replace “which allows” with “allows”
--> Done

Page 3, Line 16: Replace “they are thus also valid” with “thus also being valid”

-->Done
Page 3, Line 22: Replace “; here we prove” with “, including the proof”
--> Done
Page 4, Line 4: Replace “; variables in V” with “, variables in e”
--> Done (mais pas sure car il n'y a pas de ;)

Page 4, Definition 1: The sentence “An open transition is a tuple” sounds awkward, as it is not written as a tuple (in the usual way) afterward. It might be better to call it “the structure”, as in [6], and additionally explain it in less technical words.  The denotation of the open transition does not contain an arrow between s and s’ (as in [6]), while it appears later on in Definition 8

Page 4, Definition2: should be completely rephrased, taking into account the following issues:
-	Denotation OT_T(r) appears before it is defined, and there is no explanation given on the formula OT_T(r).
-	Replace “the variable names” with “the set of variable names”; Replace “its transitions” with “the set of transitions” (also on many other places). For example,  you can start the definition with “Let  <S,s_0,V,\sigma_0,J,T>  be an open automaton and let r\in S.
-	Clarify the part of the sentence “it will be omitted” (where from?).


Page 10: In Definition 8, I would recommend to denote the equal sets of holes just by J (instead of J_1 and J_2 satisfying J_1=J_2). In line -5, the denotation J is used.

Page 12, Line 12: Replace “this his role” with “this role”
--> Done 

Page 12: Can you provide further elaboration  on what happens in Definition 9 if H is an empty set? This directly affects the proof of transitivity, as for non-void sets H and H’, their intersection can still be empty.

## Summary

The paper introduces a simulation relation for open automata. This extends an existing line of work of open automata and bisimulation relations on such automata cf. [6,15,16] in the paper. Open automata are automata with holes in which other automata can be substituted. The paper defines 
## Overall assessment

The ideas in the paper fit into an existing line of work. Although the results are not ground-breaking, they are interesting and relevant for the SEFM audience. Although I have not checked the detailed proofs, I believe the results are correct.

## Strengths

The paper has a nice, gradual build-up of the ideas, first introducing the existing ideas of strong FH-bisimulation, and introducing the simulation relations in two steps.

## Areas for improvement

The paper already uses examples to illustrate some of the definitions and results. Still, I believe the presentation of the paper could be improved in a number of areas. First, the authors should carefully check their English grammar; it currently is sometimes confusing and incorrect. Second, some of the definitions would benefit from an intuitive explanation. In particular, for Definition 3 explain that in T = ... the action of the filled in component is the action of the hole; in Figure 4, clarify that only P is substituted in prod-cons; in Def. 8, give in informal explanation that helps the reader understand, in particular, part (2) of the definition.

\TODO{Rab: Attention Def 8 et 9 Error dans les indices}
 
The difference between definitions 8 and 9 are small; as far as I can tell, they differ in the holes that are considered. It may help the reader if the differences in Def. 9 are highlighted in one way or another.

## Minor comments

- For bisimulation, the classical definition is given before introducing the more complicated definitions for open automata. The paper would benefit from also giving the classical definition of simulation.
\TODO{S'il ya de la place remettre def. simulation otherwise mettre footenote qui le relie a la bisim} 
- The two equivalent statements on page 10 would benefit from explicitly introducing brackets. In its current form (although correct) they can lead to confusion (at least for this reviewer).
- Theorem 2 requires that A1[A3/k] is non-blocking. It would be useful to point out in the proof sketch where this assumption plays a role.

## Questions

- Is it the case that, for automata without holes, the simulation relations defined in the paper coincide with classical simulation?
